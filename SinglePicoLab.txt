Part 1

	RuleSets
		1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenJacobson/PicoLab1/master/hello_world.krl
		2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenJacobson/PicoLab1/master/echo_service.krl
		3. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenJacobson/PicoLab1/master/track_trips.krl

	RIDs
		1. hello_world
		2. echo_service
		3. track_trips

	ECI
		cj0bt4qbw0001hguz9uvj43zd

	Questions
		1. I parsed the rulesets with krl-compiler on the command line.
		2. {"directives":[{"options":{"something":"hi"},"name":"say","meta":{"rid":"echo_service","rule_name":"message","txn_id":"TODO","eid":"1556"}}]} One directive was returned. I think only this one rule ran.
		3. {"directives":[{"options":{"something":"hi"},"name":"say","meta":{"rid":"echo_service","rule_name":"message","txn_id":"TODO","eid":"1556"}},{"options":{"trip_length":"100"},"name":"trip","meta":{"rid":"track_trips","rule_name":"process_trip","txn_id":"TODO","eid":"1556"}}]} Two directives were returned. I think just the two rules ran.
		4. When the event comes into the pico, each ruleset must be searched to see if it has a domain the matches the event domain. Then each matching domian probably must be searched for a matching event type. Each type match that is found must be checked to see if it is shared and shared events will then be run to create directives.

Part 2

	RuleSets
		1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenJacobson/PicoLab1/master/track_trips_2.krl

	RIDs
		track_trips_2

	ECI
		cj0bt4qbw0001hguz9uvj43zd

	Questions
		1. I observed that the pico responded to the event. The domain and type of the event that I sent matched the new rule I registered, so that rule was run and the directive returned.
		2. I would say that the new rule is an event filter which could be considered an event intermediary. It only propagates the event on the condition that the mileage is high enough. The event does not take any action itself besides filtering.
		3. The log shows "eci: 'cj0bt4qbw0001hguz9uvj43zd' } rule selected: track_trips_2 -> count_long_trips". This shows that the count_long_trips rule executed which means it is working.
		4. I would keep track of the average_trip_length and then make long_trip anything 50% greater than the average_trip_length.
